## Minimal Path to Awesome

### Deploy Default Build

A default solution (sppkg) file for this sample exists in the [deployment](./deployment) folder. This sppkg will need to be deployed in the tenants site collection app catalog with the `Make this solution available to all sites in the organization` option selected. By doing so the solution will be available in every site collection in the tenant, however since the solution has not been enabled for SharePoint deployment it will not be seen anywhere in the UX. Instead, the Teams manifest that is included in the package will be deployed which creates a Personal App that can then be pinned to the left rail in Teams and, if desired, audience targeted to specific user groups using the [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/teams-app-setup-policies). Further, the App is then also available to be added to individual Teams to provide a Team level experience.

Steps for deployment:

1. Download the SPPKG file, navigate to the [world-clock-spfx.sppkg](./deployment/world-clock-spfx.sppkg) file in the [deployment](./deployment) folder of this repository. Select `Download` to save the file to your computer.
1. Upload the sppkg file into the tenant's app catalog by selecting upload, finding the file, and then selecting `OK`.

1. A dialog will be displayed asking if you trust the solution. **Make sure you check the `Make this solution available to all sites in the organization`** check box and then select `Deploy`.

1. After the solution has deployed you will need to sync the solution into your Teams app store. To do so, select the solution in the app catalog and then under the files tab in the ribbon the `Sync to Teams` option will be enabled, select it.

1. Assuming you received no errors while the solution during the Teams sync, you should now be able to add it into your Teams App Bar as a personal tab. You may want to consider adding the app as a custom pinned site baed on the Teams setup policies, you can learn more about doing so by visiting [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/teams-app-setup-policies). Further, for more information on changing the permissions on who has access to the app, you can read more [View app permissions and grant admin consent in the Microsoft Teams admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/app-permissions-admin-center).

1. (Optional) You may also want to add the App to one or more Teams as a new tab in a channel. To do so, navigate to the Team and Channel you want to add the App to. Select the (+) to add a new tab and search for `World Clock`. Once you have added the App as a tab it will load all the team members into the configuration allowing you to use the solution.
